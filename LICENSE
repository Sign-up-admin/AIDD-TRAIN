GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements
made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread
use, become available for other developers to incorporate.  Many open
source developers contribute their improvements to the main development
stream, but we believe that stipulating this option is the best way to
guarantee that opportunity.

  The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
distributing it under certain conditions.  These conditions are
designed to recall the spirit of sharing and improve the utility of
free software.  The GNU Affero General Public License ensures that
source code developed for a network server becomes available to the
community.  It therefore combines the GNU General Public License
with a special condition that requires network server users to provide
the source code of the modified version running there.

  Therefore, we call this license the GNU Affero General Public
License.  This license consists of the terms and conditions of the GNU
General Public License, version 3, supplemented by the additional
permission listed below.

                    ADDITIONAL PERMISSION

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  This condition supplements the terms of version 3 of the GNU General
Public License, which requires you to provide, upon request from a user
who has received a copy of a work based on the Program, the
Corresponding Source of the work.  This condition does not override
that requirement.  If you wish to combine the Program with other works
that are not covered by this License, you may do so only if the combined
work is released under the terms of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, without this additional permission.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  The terms and conditions of the GNU Affero General Public License
are the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License, version
3, supplemented by the additional permission above.
